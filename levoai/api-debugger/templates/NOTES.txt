# Levo.ai API Debugger

Three subcharts were installed:
- sensor
- collector
- jaeger

The sensor runs as a DaemonSet.  There will be one privileged sensor pod
running on each node in the cluster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the steps below to start debugging the API endpoints of your 
Kubernetes service.

1. Follow the instructions at 

https://docs.levo.ai/api-observability/common-tasks/sensor/filter-traffic#configure-kubernetes-pod-filters

to create filters to trace traffic only from your Kubernetes service. 
Update the default values file of this helm chart and do a helm upgrade.

2. Expose the Jaeger UI at localhost:16686 with:

kubectl port-forward services/levoai-jaeger 16686 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

That's it! *Happy debugging!*
