description: The Levoai Satellite Service, which receives observations from the Sensor/Envoy filters et al.
type: application
# When the docker image used by satellite et al. changes, you must bump this
# version (see T128) but you must also change
# ./charts/tagger/templates/deployment.yaml which has an 'imageversion':
version: 0.2.204
# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
